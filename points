For addresses %p
For size %u or %lu //unsigned int or unsigned long int
Never return reference(pointer) to local variable from a function --> pg-25
#include <stdlib.h> // for dynamic memory allocation
exit(1); to exit
void pointer can be assigned to any type of pointer without typecasting but we do it for code readability
A structure that contains pointers to structure of its own type is known as self referential structure
  /* useful in implementing linked lists & trees */
  struct tag{
    char name[10];
    int rollno;
    int marks;
    struct tag *p1;
    struct tag *p2;
    .
    .

  }
